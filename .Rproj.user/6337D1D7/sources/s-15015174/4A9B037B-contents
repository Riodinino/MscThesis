# Introduction

 Tropical forests shelter over half the terrestrial species present on Earth and provide numerous goods and services,  many of which have essential economic or societal value [@Foley2007;@Myers1997]. They represent a major carbon reservoir, holding up to half the estimated 558 Pg stored in vegetation worldwide [@Houghton2005]. Tropical forests are currently facing multiple perils, including deforestation for pasture or food crops, and forest degradation, for example, selective logging or fires [@Houghton2012]. Recently, @Pearson2017 estimated a yearly total of 8.29 $Pg$ carbon loss from deforestation and forest degradation worldwide. Although deforestation is easy to evaluate with satellite images, and have raised much concern over past decades, estimating and regulating the extent and emissions from forest degradation is critical, yet challenging[@Herold2011]. 
 Selective logging is the targetted harvest of a reduced number of individuals, belonging to high value timber species. Selective logging is an important cause of forest disturbance. It affected or will affect the majority of tropical forest outside protected areas [@Putz2012]. In 2011, 403.000.000 hectares were officially designated for timber extraction in tropical rainforests [@Blaser2011]. Two years earlier, @Asner2009 reported that the annual rates (regarding the area) at which these forests are selectively logged approaches 20 times those of deforestation. It is especially the case in the Amazon Basin, that encompasses half of all remaining tropical moist forest, and is an important carbon reservoir estimated to hold *ca.*90 PG of above-ground carbon [@FAO2010;@Saatchi2007;@Malhi2006]. Amazonia has been severely deforested since the early 1970s, and although overall rates substantially reduced [@INPE2015 *in* @Rappaport2018], a recent rise of small-scale deforestation, close to forest degradation, was recently noticed [@Kalamandeen2018]. In the Brazilian Amazon, selective logging impacted *ca.* 2 $Mha.y^{−1}$ between 1999 and 2002 [@Asner2005], raising resulting in emissions of about 90 $TgC.y^{−1}$, *i.e.* 15-19% higher than reported from deforestation alone over the same period [@Huang2010].   
 
 Selective logging has long rimed with irresponsible cutting [@Kormos2012], and poorly regulated harvesting. Governmental and global policies, more than two decades ago, engaged in a collective endeavor to limit this trend with the introduction of Sustainable Forest Management [SFM; United Nations, 1992]. Later on, projects such as REDD+ [Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, @UNFCCC2008] linked SFM and climate change to pursue one common cause, using financial incentives.  In parallel, aset of techniques and planning guidelines were introduced to mitigate the adverse effects of conventional selective logging, under the name "Reduced impact logging" (RIL). RIL is increasingly implemented and promoted as a cornerstone to achieving both ecologically and economically viable forest management [@Putz2008]. It is somehow seen as a reasonable compromise between clearcutting and outright protection [@Putz2012]. Some authors argue in favor of RIL's potential to sustain essential ecosystemic and services, such as the ecosystem's conservation value, above-ground biomass, and timber yields [@Putz2012]. Conversely, Others insist on the apparent non-sustainability of current practices, and affirm that they are only leading to depletion of timber volumes, carbon stocks, and biological diversity, due to mismatches between minimum economic viability, and subtle ecosystem functioning - on timescales far beyond ours [see @Nasi2009 and @Kormos2012].
 
 There is no available dataset for more than two cutting cycles. We have insights that resource use-up is ensured at the second or third cutting cycle [@Kormos2012; but see @Putz2012]. Data on forest biomass recovery has also intensively been studied, yielding contrasted conclusions worldwide. Likely, carbon stock is the first global ecosystemic variable to be recovered after a disturbance [Sist et al., 2015], but the nature of the stands is very different. A majority of commercial timber species (and mature forest trees) are long-lived, shade-tolerant species, rely on complex pollination and dispersal strategies to maintain viable population sizes, and occur low concentration of individuals per spatial unit. They are, in many cases, outcompeted by pioneers, light-responsive species, which contribute carbon stocks transiently and may slow others regeneration [@Nasi2009]. 
 
These observations are for short time-scales. To produce at least conservative estimates of what our actions yield, over time-scales that we cannot apprehend, the use of models is a relevant approach. After all, this is the only source of *a priori* information that we can use to orientate long-term management decisions.
 Most simulation studies on selective logging focused on carbon [@Piponiot2016;@Rutishauser2015; @Huang2008] with more or less large-scale approaches. Up to now, relatively few simulation studies addressed the sustainability of selective logging at the plots' scale, especially for long timescales. @Sist2007 and @Dauber2005 simulated growth and mortality of remaining stands on logged plots, in the Eastern and Western Amazon, respectively. In the Paragominas (Brasil), @Valle2007  used individual-based models to assess timber yields over cutting cycles, but used only 10 species groups, which is somehow restrictive [see @Marechaux2017] @Huth2001, did a relatively complete assessment of cutting cycle durations and target volumes on Malaysian dipterocarp forests, further discussed in @Huth2003, but again using only 10 species groups to model hyper-diverse forests. @Gourlet-Fleury2005a also used an individual-based model to simulate timber stocks recovery for *Dicorynia guianensis*, the principal harvested species in French Guiana  [@Guitet2011]. There is a need for models either enabling simulation of selective logging for large time scales (over centuries) and integrating fine-scale processes and species diversity. Individual-based and spatial-explicit models are thus offering a perspective to address this need. 
 
 TROLL is an individual-based forest simulator that jointly simulates species diversity and carbon dynamics [@Marechaux2017a], over time scales ranging from years to centuries. It explicitly accounts for the influence of species-specific functional traits and competition for light on individuals life cycle (growth, mortality, recruitment, reproduction). We used TROLL to bring a first contribution to the assessment of selective logging sustainability in French Guiana.
 
Our aims were: 
* to get as close as possible to the actual logged forests in terms of diversity; * to model selective logging realistically, given field reality and the model limits; 
* to preliminary explore of possible scenarios for the wood industry in French Guiana; 
* to make a generic tool that allows testing more scenarios. 

To match these goals, we followed four steps. We first inferred a new species input dataset to simulate more species in French Guianese forests. We then attempted a validation and calibration of post-logging recovery with TROLL, using real censuses from logged and undisturbed plots of the Paracou disturbance experiment. Subsequently, we updated the existing selective logging module to include features such as multiple cutting cycles, conventional logging, designation with species interest ranking, and continuous monitoring of merchantable trees. Finally, we did a pilot-experiment, simulating two cutting cycles, two target volumes, three diversification scenarios, RIL and CL, on two primary forests with contrasted initial timber stocks.
