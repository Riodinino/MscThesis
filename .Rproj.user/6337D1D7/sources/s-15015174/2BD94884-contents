sequester carbon from the global atmosphere, regulate the

OK lets go[@Guariguata2000]

@Andrade2017 proposed average emissions 19.9 MgC/ha for logging and 46.0 MgC/ha
forest degradation from logging fire is a major threat

@piponiot2016 We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west (21 ±3 Mg C ha-1) than in the south (12 ±3 Mg C ha-1)  http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21394.002

  in the Brazilian Amazon alone, about 2 Mha yr−1 were logged in 1999–2002 (Asner et al., 2005)



The extent of selective logging in the Brasilian Amazon was equivalent to annual deforestation in the same period, and resulted in C emissions of 90 Tg C yr-1 (Huang and Asner, 2010) 
which increased anthropogenic C emissions by almost 25% over deforestation alone (Asner et al., 2005)

Although annual deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon have declined by 80% since 2004 (Hansen et al 2014, INPE 2015) in @rappaport

Even if the Carbon emissions involved are high ,uncertainties in carbon accounting (@Rappaport2018, PIPONIOT). The REDD+ accounting framework is supposed(@Mertz2012)Growing attention is paid to forest degradation, althought high uncertaineties making its integration in REDD+,
