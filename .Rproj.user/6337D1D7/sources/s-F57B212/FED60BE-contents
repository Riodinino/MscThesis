# Conclusions and perspectives

We inferred seven traits means for 547 species, resulting in better coverage of Paracou species, needed to address our goals. Post-logging trajectories were not reproducible starting from real censuses because of abnormally high mortality during the five first years of simulation. We hypothesized that this could be related to the model's structure and assumptions. We verified this hypothesis using spatial statistics and found an overdispersion of canopy trees (>30 cm dbh) in TROLL, not observed in real data. Our results indicate that calibration of post-logging recovery with TROLL requires another approach than inputting real data into the model. We implemented new generic functionalities to simulate selective logging in two different ways (CL and RIL) and test variations of essential silviculture parameters such as cutting cycle duration, target volume, minimum cutting diameters, and preferences among timber species. This enables to investigate a wide range of scenarios with TROLL. 

Finally, we did a preliminary set of simulations, testing 24 scenarios in two different forests. Preliminary results indicate that ecosystem damages are both sensitive to the target volumes, and the logging techniques used. In the model, the gain of RIL regarding damages is mitigated by high harvest intensities. Every scenario we tested to similar long-term trajectories. Current cutting cycles seem inadequate with Sustainable Forest Management, no matter what exactly one wants to sustain: carbon stocks and timber volumes undergo a long-term decreased in our simulations. Above-ground biomass trajectories are consistent with forest secondarisation. We did not test the impact of logging on species diversity and composition in the long term, but it is likely that pioneer species take advantage of the repeated disturbances caused by multiple harvests. The majority of the extractible fuelwood volume, over two rotations, concern trees damages during secondary tracks opening. The results suggest that TROLL could be useful to explore scenarios and provide first estimates of the quantity of fuelwood that could be valorized from damaged trees during operations.

Our experiment, however, lacked replication: we used only two different forests and did only five replicates per scenario and forest. These **preliminary** results must not be overinterpreted. Instead, they give a clue of what else to test, and which effects to separate to further use this model. Moreover, the external seed arrival may have been underestimated by our parametrization, and the bias it causes regarding merchantable species recovery yet has to be evaluated.

TROLL is a model and thus has limits. TROLL is based on some simplifying assumptions that have significant implications for silviculture modeling. For example, the topography is not yet included in the model, although it is the most limiting constraint during planifications and harvests. Belowground processes and soil characteristics are not yet included. Additionnally, the external seed rain is difficult to tune in order to have realistic results, yet it influences strongly the results of simulations [@Schmitt2017]. The logging model needs refinement and optimization, and relies on simplifying assumptions. The outpout generated also need a proper calibration to assess their realism, which we did not suceed to do from real censuses. 

Still, TROLL has a promising potential to assess the impacts of selective logging. Its spatialisation and finesse offer more realism than many models previously used. Future updates of the model will bring interesting improvements, such as the explicit integration of water fluxes [@Marechaux2017]. The implementation of silvicultural treatment in the logging module are also a potential perspective, because many authors advise their use, but insights of their efficiency on large time scales are simply inexistant. We hope that this study is only the first step of a longer-term work, that will bring interesting results and help improving forest management.
