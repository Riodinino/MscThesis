# Appendix 1: TROLL model

This appendix provides a description of the model, adapted from @Marechaux2017 and @Schmitt2017.

## Abiotic environment

The abiotic environment is explicitely modelled in a voxel space, with a resolution of 1 $m^3$. For each tree crown, leaf area density is calculated assuming a uniform distriution across voxels occupied by the crown. Leaf area density is computed within each voxel summing all tree crowns inside the voxel $v$, and is noted $LAD(v)$ (leaf area per voxel in $mÂ².m^{-3}$). The vertical sum of $LAD$ from voxel $v$ to the soil is $LAI(v)$ (leaf area index; $m^2.m^{-2}$) :

\begin{equation}
  LAI(v) = \sum _{v'=v} ^\infty LAD(v') 
  (\#eq:LAI)
\end{equation}

Daily variations in light intensity (taken as photosynthetic photon flux density PPFD in $\mu mol_{photons}.m^{-2}.s^{-1}$), temperature (T in $^{\circ}C$), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD in $kPA$) are computed to assess carbon assimilation within each voxel for a representative day per month. Variation of PPFD within the canopy is calculated with a Beer-Lambert extinction law:

\begin{equation}
  PPFD_{max,month}(v) = PPFD_{top,max,month}*e^{-k*LAI(v)}
  (\#eq:PPFD)
\end{equation}

The daily maximum incident PPFD at the top of canopy $PPFD_{top,max,month}$ is an input variable. The extinction rate $k$ is assumed as constant. Only vertical light diffusion is considered. 
Intra-day variation at half-hourly time steps $t$, for a representative day per month, are used to compute $PPFD_{month}(v,t)$, $T_{month}(v,t)$ and $VPD_{month}(v,t)$. Water and nutrient process both in soil and inside trees are not simulated, for now (but water fluxes are going to be implemented soon)

## Photosynthesis

### Theory

Troll simulates individual's carbon uptake of each with the Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry model for C3 photosynthesis [@Farquhar1980]. Gross carbon assimilation rate ($A$ in $\mu mol~CO_2. m^{-2}.s^{-1}$) is limited by eiter Rubisco carboxylation activity ($A_v$) or RuBP regeneration ($A_j$):

\begin{equation}
  A=min(A_v, A_j)~|~A_v=V_{cmax}*\frac{c_i-\Gamma^*}{c_i+K_m}~;~A_j=\frac{J}{4}*\frac{c_i-\Gamma^*}{c_i+2*\Gamma^*}
  (\#eq:A)
\end{equation}

$V_{cmax}$ is the maximum carboxylation rate ($\mu mol~CO_2.m^{-2}.s^{-1}$). $c_i$ is the $CO_2$ partial pressure at carboxylation sites. $\Gamma^*$ is the $CO_2$ compensation point in absence of dark respiration. $K_m$ is the apparent knietic constant of Rubisco enzyme. $J$ is the electron transport rate ($\mu mol e^-.m^{-2}.s^{-1}$), and depends on the light intensity with $PPFD$:

\begin{equation}
  J = \frac{1}{2*\theta}*[\alpha*PPFD+J_{max}-\sqrt{(\alpha*PPFD+J_{max})^2}-4*\theta*\alpha*PPFD*J_{max}]
  (\#eq:J)
\end{equation}

$J_{max}$ is the maximal electron transport capacity ($\mu mol e^-.m^{-2}.s^{-1}$), $\theta$ is the curvature factor and $\alpha$ is the apparent quantum yield of electron transport ($mole^-.mol~photons^{-1}$).

Carbon assimilation by photosynthesis are the limited by $CO_2$ partial pressure at carboxylation sites. Stomata control this throught stomatal transport:

\begin{equation}
  A = g_s*(c_a-c_i)
  (\#eq:Ag)
\end{equation}

$g_s$ is the stomatal conductance to $CO_2$ ($molCO_2.m^{-2}.s^{-1}$). 

TROLL simulates $g_s$ with the model from [@Medlyn2011]:

\begin{equation}
  g_s = g_0 + (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})*\frac{A}{c_a}
  (\#eq:gs)
\end{equation}

TROLL model assume $g_0 \approx 0$ (empirically tested and considered as reasonable), and $g_1$ is given as an input.

### Parametrization

@Domingues2010 suggested that $V_{cmac}$ and $J_{max}$ were both limited by the leaf concentration of nitrogen $N$ and phosphorus $P$ ($mg.g^{-1}$):

\begin{equation}
  log_{10} V_{cmax-M} = min( 
  \begin{array}{c} 
    -1.56+0.43*log_{10} N-0.37*log_{10} LMA \\
    -0.80+0.45*log_{10} P-0.25*log_{10} LMA 
  \end{array} 
  )
  (\#eq:VcmaxM)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  log_{10} J_{max-M} = min(
  \begin{array}{c} 
    -1.50+0.41*log_{10} N-0.45*log_{10} LMA \\
    -0.74+0.44*log_{10} P-0.32*log_{10} LMA 
  \end{array}
  )
  (\#eq:JmaxM)
\end{equation}

$V_{cmax-M}$ and $J_{max-M}$ are the photosynthetic capacities at $25^\circ C$, for mature leaves and per leaf dry mass (respectively, $\mu mol CO_2.g^-1.s^{-1}$ and $\mu mol e^-.g^{-1}.s^{-1}$). $LMA$ is the leaf mass per area ($g.cm^{-2}$). $V_{cmax}$ and $J_{max}$ are calculated by multiplying $V_{cmax-M}$ and $J_{max-M}$ by $LMA$. $V_{cmax}$ and $J_{max}$ variation with temperature are calculated with @Bernacchi2003.

TROLL computes leaf carbon assimilation $A_l$ combining equations from \@ref(eq:A) to \@ref(eq:JmaxM), for each crown voxel within each crown layer $l$:

\begin{equation}
  A_l = \frac{1}{n_v*t_M} * \sum_v  \sum^{t_M}_{t=1} A(PPFD_{month}(v,t),VPD_{month}(v,t),T_{month}(v,t))
  (\#eq:Al)
\end{equation}

$PPFD_{month}(v,t)$, $VPD_{month}(v,t)$ , and $T_{month}(v,t)$ are derived from site-specific climatic data; $n_v$ is the number of voxels within crown layer $l$; And the sum is calculated over the $t_M$ half-hourly intervals $t$ of a tipical day.

## Autotrophic respiration

A large fraction of plants carbon uptake is actually used for plant maintenance and growth respiration. The autotrophic respiration can represents up to 65% of the gross primary productivity but varies strongly among species, sites, and environnements.

TROLL uses @Atkin2015 database of mature leaf dark respiration and associated leaf traits to compute leaf maintenance respiration:

\begin{equation}
  R_{leaf-M} = 8.5431-0.1306*N-0.5670*P-0.0137*LMA+11.1*V_{cmax-M}+0.1876*N*P
  (\#eq:Rl)
\end{equation}

$R_{leaf-M}$ si the dark respiration rate per leaf dry mass at a temperaure of $25^\circ C$ ($nmolCO_2.g^{-1}.s^{-1}$). The other terms are in equations \@ref(eq:VcmaxM) and \@ref(eq:JmaxM). 

TROLL assumes leaf respiration during the day to be 40% of leaf dark respiration, and computes total leaf respiration by accounting for the length of the daylight.

TROLL model stem respiration ($R_{stem}$ in $\mu molC.s^{-1}$) with a constant respiration rate per volume of sapwood:

\begin{equation}
  R_{stem} = 39.6*\pi*ST*(dbh-ST)*(h-CD)
  (\#eq:Rs)
\end{equation}

dbh, h, CD and ST are tree diameter at breast height, height, crown depth and sapwood thickness, respectively ($m$). TROLL assumes $ST=0.04~m$ when $dbh>30~cm$ and an increasing $ST$ for lower $dbh$.

TROLL computes fine root maintenance respiration as half the leaf maintenance respiration,and coarse root and branch maintenance respirations as half the stem respiration. Growth respiration ($R_{growth}$) is assumed to account for 25% of the gross primary productivity minus the sum of maintenance respirations.

## Net carbon uptake

Net primary production of carbon for one individual $NPP_{ind}$ ($gC$) is computed with gross primary production $GPP_{ind}$ and respirations $R$:

\begin{equation}
  NPP_{ind} = GPP_{ind} - R_{maintenance} - R_{growth}
  (\#eq:NPP)
\end{equation}

TROLL separates total leaf area $LA$, for each individual, into three pools corresponding to different photosynthesis efficiency (young, mature and old leaves with $LA_{young}$, $LA_{mature}$, and $LA_{old}$ respectively). Growth primary production for one individual is thus computed as as:

\begin{equation}
  GPP_{ind} = 189.3 * \Delta t * \sum _{l= \lfloor h-CD \rfloor +1} ^{\lfloor h \rfloor} [A_l] * (\frac{LA_{young}}{2} + LA_{mature} + \frac{LA_{old}}{2})
  (\#eq:GPP)
\end{equation}

With h and CD the tree height and crown depth($m$). $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the rounding function. $\Delta t$ is the duration of a timestep ($year$).

Carbon allocation to wood is computed as an increment of stem volume $\Delta V$ ($m^3$):

\begin{equation}
  \Delta V = 10^{-6} * \frac{f_{wood}*NPP_{ind}}{0.5*wsg}*Senesc(dbh)
  (\#eq:DeltaV)
\end{equation}

$f_{wood}$ is the fixed fraction of NPP allocated to stem and branches. $wsg$ is the wood specific gravity ($g.cm^{-3}$, see \@ref(tab:traits)). TROLL assume large trees to undergo a size-related growth decline with function $Senesc$ after a specific diameter at brest height threshold $dbh_{thresh}$:

\begin{equation}
  Senesc(dbh) = max(0;3-2*\frac{dbh}{dbh_{thresh}})
  (\#eq:Senesc)
\end{equation}

Allocation to canopy is computed with canopy NPP fraction, $f_{canopy}$ decomposed into leaf, twig and fruit production. Carbon allocation to leaf results in a new young leaf pool, whereas other leaf pools are updated as follow:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c} \\
   \Delta LA_{young} = \frac{2*f_{leaves}*NPP_{ind}}{LMA}-\frac{LA_{young}}{\tau_{young}} \\
  \Delta LA_{mature} = \frac{LA_{young}}{\tau_{young}} - \frac{LA_{mature}}{\tau_{mature}}\\
  \Delta LA_{old} = \frac{LA_{mature}}{\tau_{mature}} - \frac{LA_{old}}{\tau_{old}}
  \end{array}
  (\#eq:DeltaLA)
\end{equation}

$\tau_{young}$, $\tau_{mature}$, and $\tau_{old}$ are species-specific leaf residence times for each leaf pool ($years$). Their sum is the leaf lifespan $LL = \tau_{young} + \tau_{mature} + \tau_{old}$ ($years$). $\tau_{young}$ is set to one month and $\tau_{mature}$ is set to a third of leaf lifespan $LL$. Belowground carbon allocation is not simulated inside TROLL.


## Tree growth

With the increment in stem volume $\Delta V$ calculated with equation \@ref(eq:DeltaV), TROLL derives an increment of tree diameter at breast height denoted $\Delta dbh$. It infer tree height from $dbh$ using a Michaelis-Menten equation:

\begin{equation}
  h = h_{lim}*\frac{dbh}{dbh + a_h}
  (\#eq:h)
\end{equation}

and the trunk volume is $V = C * \pi * (\frac{dbh}{2})^2*h$, thus:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c} \\
    \Delta V = C*\frac{1}{2}*\pi*h*dbh*\Delta dbh + C * \pi * (\frac{dbh}{2})^2*h \\
    \Delta V = V*\frac{\Delta dbh}{dbh}*(3-\frac{dbh}{dbh + ah})
  \end{array}
  (\#eq:Deltadbh)
\end{equation}

Then, TROLL uses the new trunk dimension ($dbh$ and $h$) to update tree crown geometry using allometric equations [@Chave2005]:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c} \\
    CR = 0.80 + 10.47*dbh - 3.33*dbh^2\\
    CD = -0.48 + 0.26*h~;~CD = 0.13 + 0.17*h~(h<5~m)
  \end{array}
  (\#eq:C)
\end{equation}

The mean leaf density is finally computed within the crown ($LD$ in $m^2.m^{-3}$) assuming a uniform distribution:

\begin{equation}
  LD = \frac{LA_{young}+LA_{mature}+LA_{old}}{\pi*CR^2*CD}
  (\#eq:LD)
\end{equation}

## Mortality

Mortality is partitioned in three factors inside TROLL: background death $d_b$, treefall death $d_t$ and negative density dependent death $d_{NDD}$. Because density dependent death $d_{NDD}$ is currently at development stage.

@Chave2009 opposed fast growing light wood species species, with high risk of mortality, to slow growing dense wood species, with reduced mortality. In TROLL, background mortality is derived from wood specific gravity $wsg$:

\begin{equation}
  d_b = m*(1-\frac{wsg}{wsg_{lim}})+d_n
  (\#eq:db)
\end{equation}

$m$ ($events.year^{-1}$) is the reference death rate for lighter wood species (pioneers). $d_n$ represents death by carbon starvation. If the number of consecutive day with $NPP_{ind}< 0$ \@ref(eq:NPP) is superior to tree leaf lifespan $d_n$ is set to 1 and remains null in other cases.

Mortality by treefall inside TROLL depends on a specific stochastic threshold $\theta$:

\begin{equation}
  \theta = h_{max}*(1-v_T*|\zeta|)
  (\#eq:theta)
\end{equation}

$h_{max}$ is the maximal tree height. $v_T$ is the variance term set to 0.3. $|\zeta|$ is the absolute value of a random centered and scaled Gaussian. If the tree height $h$ is superior to $\theta$ then the tree may fall with a probability $1-\theta/h$ [@Chave1999]. The treefall direction is random (drawn from a uniform law ($\mathcal{U}[0,2\pi]$). All tree in the trajectory of the falling tree will be hurted through a variable denoted $hurt$, incremented by fallen tree height $h$. If a tree height is inferior than its $hurt$ values then it may die with a probability $1-\frac{1}{2}\frac{h}{hurt}$. $hurt$ variable is reset to null at each timestep ($month$).

## Recruitment

Once the tree became fertile they will start to disperse seeds. TROLL consider tree as fertile after a specific height threshold $h_{mature}$ [@Wright2005]:

\begin{equation}
  h_{mature} = -11.47+0.90*h_{max}
  (\#eq:hmature)
\end{equation}

TROLL is not considering seed directly through a seedbank, instead seed might be interpreted as a seedling recruitment opportunity. The number of reproduction opportunities per mature tree is denoted $n_s$ and set to 10 for all species. This assumption originates from a trade-off between seed number and seed size resulting in equivalent survival and recruitment probability. All $n_s$ events are dispersed with a distance randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution. 

Additionally, TROLL model consider external seedrain through $n_{ext}$ events of seed immigration:

\begin{equation}
  n_{ext} = N_{tot}*f_{reg}*n_{ha}
  (\#eq:next)
\end{equation}

$N_{tot}$ is the external seedrain per hectare (number of reproduction opportunities). $f_{reg}$ is the species regional frequency. $n_{ha}$ is the simulated plot size in $ha$. 

The seedrain has important implications in the model, because it influences the equilibrium stats of the model and the regeneration after a disturbance [@Schmitt2017]

A bank of seedlings to be recruited is defined for each pixel. If the ground-level light reaches a species light compensation point $LCP$ the species will be recruited:

\begin{equation}
  LCP = \frac{R_{leaf}}{\phi}
  (\#eq:LCP)
\end{equation}

$R_{leaf}$ is the leaf respiration for maintenance (see \@ref(eq:Rl)). $\phi$ is the quantum yield ($\mu mol C.\mu mol~photon$) set to 0.06. If several species reach their $LCP$, one is picked at random. Seedlings are recruited with following intial geometry:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c} \\
    dbh = \frac{a_h}{h_{max} - 1}\\
    h = 1~m\\
    CR = 0.5~m\\
    CD = 0.3~m\\
    LD = 0.8~m^2.^{-3}
  \end{array}
  (\#eq:C)
\end{equation}
